Project Daedalus, based on Eclipse Engine in Godot 4.3

Work done:
	-	Desktop scene
	-	Shift from desktop scene to Freeplay and vice versa
	-	Custom Charts have been figured out (go into a song and press 7, dont do it in the main menu as that
		will break and crash.  I dont know why that happens

What is needed:
	-	loading different "applications" on the desktop should take you to that area and back (ie: freeplay button on the desktop that will take you back and forth)
	-	figure out how the fuck bounding boxes work cus im a fucking idiot and dont know why things act the way they do
	-	basic sub window thing i guess?
